This should be self-explanatory :-)

Extract the programs into a directory called "protop".  Start a session against
your target database.  For instance:

	mpro sports -p protop.p -param "i;10|d;Summary,User IO"

will start the monitor against "sports" with a 10 second interval using "User IO"
for it's initial display.

Type "h" or "?" for help.

To create a new display clone one which is similar to the sort of presentation
that you'd like (uio.p and resrc.p are a good examples) and modify it to suit.

There's plenty of room for additional metrics in summary.p too.

If you come up with something neat feel free to forward it to me.  If I like it
I'll include it in the package.

If there's something you'd like to see let me know -- I may add it.

If there's something you don't like (including the coding style) tell me about
that too -- I may choose to ignore you but I'd still like to hear it ;-)

It looks better and is perhaps more useful on a "tall" screen.  If you have a
vt100 emulator you can add a "tall" vt100 to protermcap by adding this entry:

	vt100-t|Tall vt100:\
	        :li#40:\
		:tc=vt100:

Then just stretch your window and change your TERM environment variable.

Or, if you prefer, use the supplied protermcap found in etc/protermcap.protop.
