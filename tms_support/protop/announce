ProTop Release xix
==================


New Stuff
---------

 - Added new display types for:

	+ Helpers -- BIW, AIW and APW information
	+ Connection Summary -- Show Overall hit ratio as well as the
	  breakout between interactive and batch sessions.
	+ Config and Startup -- Show key configuration and startup
	  details.

 - Moved highly variable configuration details from lib/protop.i to
   etc/protop.cfg.

 - Added color coded alert definitions to etc/alert.cfg -- you need a
   color capable emulator and a proper protermcap to take advantage of
   this.  There is a sample in etc/protermcap.protop.

 - R-Code for people who cannot compile ProTop!

 - Added OS specific monitoring for Linux, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX and Tru64
	+ df		Free disk space
	+ netstat	Network traffic

 - Added experimental "eXtended _Connect" feature to determine UNIX
   username and CPU time from "ps".  Rename mon/xconnect.px to
   mon/xconnect.p to enable this feature for your system (it may be
   a performance problem on large systems).


Removed
-------

 - Unused scripts

 - db, log & util directories -- these currently are too complex for
   ProTop's mission.


Small Changes
-------------

 - Changed from %used to %allocated when reporting storage area utilization.

 - Minor renaming of display types to better standardize names.

 - Cleaned up some column labels and alignments.

 - Added a few fields here and there.

 - Updates to help files.

 - Reorganized OS specific directory tree to be based off "uname -a"
 

Bug Fixes
---------

 - Cleaned up some share locks that somehow crept in :-(

 - Fixed the GUI startup bug.

 - Fixed the "goslow" bug.  Joins of _UserIO and _Connect are now fast.

 - Various other small stuff that I didn't keep very good notes about :-(
