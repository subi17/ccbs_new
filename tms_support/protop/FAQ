Q) Can I use ProTop with Windows?

A) Yes.  You can run ProTop with the "character client".  Or a GUI client.
   ProTop is currently a "stream-io" GUI application -- it isn't terribly
   pretty but you do get multiple windows and a lot of mouse sensitive
   behavior.



Q) ProTop only shows TableStats for the first 50 tables in my schema.  What
   can I do?

A) By default Progress only collects table & index statistics for the first
   50 tables in your schema.  You can, however, start your database with the
   -tablerangesize option to increase this window.



Q) Some display screens aren't showing any data -- but I'm sure that they
   should be.

A) If you have you set the current page number to a page beyond the last
   data items there won't be any data to display.  Use the "p" option to
   see your current page number setting and reset it.



Q) Can I use ProTop with Progress version 8?

A) ProTop uses a feature of the 4gl known as "Publish and Subscribe" or
   "Named Events" which is only available in version 9 and above.
   Furthermore the source of monitoring data is Virtual System Tables (VSTs)
   which were first introduced in version 8.2.  None the less it is possible
   to use ProTop via a remote connection (client/server) to a version 8
   database if you have a version 9 license available.  You will probably
   need to modify some code to account for differences in VST organization
   if you do that.  Various modules in the "mon" subdirectory will not compile
   if the target is a v8 database -- the simple thing to do is to rename them
   and figure out what needs to change later.
